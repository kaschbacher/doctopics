Dr Brody did the surgery on both my thumbs as couple years ago, for trigger thumbs on both hands. It went perfectly and both thumbs are perfect today. TODAY I went to Dr Brody for trigger finger in my middle finger and I was stressing a bit about getting a cortisone injection, which seemed like the obvious first step. I know those are painful and simply unpleasant. Doctor Brody is a superstar when it comes to injections. Kudos to him for a nearly painless event that took hardly any time. I highly recommend Doctor Brody. Despite what some people have commented on Yelp, Doctor Brody was clear with his explanation and took all the time I needed for a few questions. I never felt 'rushed' or like the Doc didn't have time for me.
