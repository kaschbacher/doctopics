I need a new hip and my primary care doctor told me if he was to have this surgery he would have Doctor Gilbert do it. I went there and was so surprised to have a doctor who spent over an hour with me and seemed concerned about me.  I am so confident that after this surgery the end of December I will once again be able to walk without the current bone on bone pain which I am experiencing. The staff was so friendly and all the magazines in the waiting room were new. He also has called me twice to see how I am coping.
