I moved away from Fremont to Oakland and had to find a new Orthopedic Surgeon. I was so grateful to get a referral from my new from Primary Physician. I was scared and very nervous because I thought my previous doctor of 8 years was the best ever and I did not believe I would find a doctor that was, at best, comparable. Well to my pleasant surprise Dr. Taylor exceeded my hope and expectations! Dr.Taylor is the most skilled, compassionate and thorough doctor in his field I have ever met! My knee and shoulder injections we so painless and effective and so much better than what I had received from my former doctor! The injections worked immediately and lasted much longer than the ones I had ever received in the past. Not only did I develop an instant trust in him but now I can comfortably have my knee replaced without procrastinating because of that trust.I would also like to comment on how wonderful and warm is staff treated me and other patients while I observed. The office is very clean, organized and esthetically designed. I am truly blessed to have found Dr. Scott Taylor.Thank you, sincerely!
