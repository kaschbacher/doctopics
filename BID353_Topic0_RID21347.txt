Had a left hip revision and he was amazing. We went over the many options and I wanted to be aggressive and take out my 17 year old hip and put in one of the newer models. He convinced me otherwise which it turns out it was the right thing to do because my hip was so grown in it would have destroyed the surrounding bone. Really nice man and good bedside manner. One of the best in the state if not in all of the US.
