I trusted Dr. Saxena with the surgery, which was a limited success. He is a man of very few words. Office visits last less than 5 minutes, though the wait might be 30 minutes. He doesn't seem really interested in how I feel about things, what I'm experiencing, or what my questions might be. He answers questions with about 3 words, leaving me feeling like either I should ask the same question again, or just leave still wondering. He dismisses any concern over how your foot lookswill only talk about function. I believe he's a good surgeon, but his overall treatment of patients leaves something to be desired.
